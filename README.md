## weather-aggregation
Project simulating data aggregation to minimize transfer size while still being useful
## project steps
- data input
using an sdr usb, connect to weather vane over wifi
store raw data on raspberry pi indoors
- data manipulation
develop weather prediction algorithm to take comparatively large amounts of data and convert into
comparatively small pieces of actionable information
- data output
develep windowless browser front end to display on raspberry pi to view information or to select
what information to send to a server hosted on local computer
compare transformed data to actual weather to compare efficacy
